		<h2><label for="">Do you want to delete your account?</label></h2>
		<p>We think it's sad if you want to leave us but send an e-mail to <a href="">post@minsmajobb.no</a> and we will of course help you delete or deactivate your account. If you are a helper and bothered by many alerts by e-mail, you can easily turn this off under the menu "settings" and "Alerts" - If you remove the check mark from all types of assignments, it will be completely silent from us until you choose to turn alerts on again.</p>
		<p> If there are other things you are not completely satisfied with, we can mention that minsm√•jobb.no is still in the development phase and there are major improvements from month to month. In addition, between 40 and 100 new users register every day and it becomes easier to find work and not least to find help with each passing day. We will be very happy if you allow us some childhood illnesses now and then </p>
